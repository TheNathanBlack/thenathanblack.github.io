<p>Look, I am really well suited for this position, but a traditional resume wouldn't show much of the actual picture of why I would be awesome at this job. So I'm going to try this weirdo approach, which is a better distillation of who I am anyway.</p>
<p>I've been in games my entire working career in one form or another. In the early nineties I managed a board, puzzle, and roleplaying game store. In the early 2000s I started working in the video game industry on titles like Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Thief 3, Trivial Pursuit: Millennium Edition and Barbie Pet Rescue. In recent years I've taken up with the local indie video game scene, working with independent game developers working on passion projects like Spider: Rite of The Shrouded Moon and Monstrocards.</p>
<p>I've personally backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/nathanblack">128 projects on kickstarter</a> and I support over <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NathanBlack">20 creators on Patreon</a>. I've even been in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whitewhalegames/monstrocards-a-creative-drawing-game-of-horrific-h/description">kickstarter video</a> for the Monstrocards game. I really believe in crowdfunding and the Kickstarter model as a way forward for interesting new games that might not have had a way to get funded or even noticed in the past. I remember the rush of backing my first project and feeling like I was contributing directly to the good things I wanted to see in the world. Giving directly to the people that do the work is a powerful feeling.</p>
<p>I'm also a part time stunt man, but even that ends up being game related (I play Mario!): </p>

<h2>Conventioneer</h2>
<p>In more recent years, I've worked with the indie video game crews in Austin, not only on the games themselves, but also working with the local indie game development scene as a whole. I'm down with the <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/">Juegos Rancheros</a> crew and I'm helping MC <a href="http://fantasticfest.com/arcade">Fantastic Arcade</a>. I'm known locally as a connector, someone who can either get things done or knows the person who can.</p>
<p>I worked at GenCon demoing games for Last Unicorn Games and Cheapass Games back in the early 2000s, more recently I worked show floors doing security for celebrities and managing large crowds for Wizard World Comic Cons in Philadelphia, New Orleans, Portland, and Austin.</p>
<p>I am currently working with <a href="http://www.bigbadcon.com/">Big Bad Con</a> serving as their Conflict Mediator and working on their <a href="http://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/">Community Standards</a></p>
<div class="row"> 
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
<blockquote class="small">
<p>"Nathan Black is the conflict mediator for Big Bad Con and we are delighted that we have him. The current climate of gender, racial, and class based harassment and discrimination mandates a reliable, aware, and considerate response. Nathan offers all of that to our attendees and our staff. He has not only improved the convention's outward facing presence for our attendees, but also educated our staff to be better allies and first responders."</p>

<h2>Project Manager</h2>
<p>One of my many career paths is managing projects and small engineering teams. I've lead teams making apps, integrated development environments, and launched games. What I enjoy most about this work is supporting the people on my teams, helping them grow, and removing obstacles from their paths. My basic operating theory is to give engineers the support they need, a clear and reasonable work load and to remove all impediments.</p>
<div class="row"> 
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
<blockquote class="small">
<p>"In our experience Nathan Black is an efficient and resourceful collaborator. He is empathetic, good at maintaining relationships and connections, and values attention to detail. We can always count on Nathan to help resolve conflicts and produce positive outcomes. He's pretty much the greatest."</p>

<h2>Game Credits</h2>
<p>I've worked on a combination of critically acclaimed triple-A titles, shovel-ware, and indie games. This is a highlight reel.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<h3>Managerial</h3>
<p>I am very good at working with and improving processes. From helping teams to a finish line to adapting daily workflow and semi-formal agile practices. One of the things I enjoy most is seeing engineers in my charge grow and improve.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>I am a creative community builder. I founded, MC'd for, and ran the first branch of <a href="http://www.drsketchy.com/">Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School</a> outside of New York City. I regularly MC events ranging from variety shows to Blue Genie's annual <a href="http://www.dangerderby.com/">Danger Derby</a>, a local rules-limited-danger-enhanced pinebox derby race.</p>
<h3>Technical</h3>
<p>I am a journeyman Python coder, specializing in build process and practices.</p>
<p>I am proficient with the following technologies:
Python, Buildbot, Twitter Bootstrap, git, GitHub, Steam, HTML5, CSS3, Go, Docker, bash, Pelican, Flask, and many more.</p>
<div class="row">

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>I'm a candidate with a deep love of independent games. I'm a passionate community builder with a broad mix of skills. I am very excited about this position, because it lines up with my personal values, my passion for games, and my broad skill set. I look forward to the opportunity to put those skills to work for something I care about.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>My legal name is Nathan Regener, but most people know me by Nathan Black. A lot of my credits and work history show up as Nathan Regener.</p>
<p>In the course of writing this I actually had to increment the number of kickstarter's I've backed.</p>
<p>For a more standard look at my work profile, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanregener">LinkedIn for Nathan Regener</a> is probably the best portal. That's where the best standard job recommendations for me are as well.</p>
